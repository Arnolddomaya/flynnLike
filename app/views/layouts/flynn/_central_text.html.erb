                Deployment. Ops. Databases. Containers. Configuration management.

            <p>
                Flynn is all you need to know.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>

            <p>

                and regularly integrate new components and features, so you get the best
                technology without having to figure out how everything fits together.
            </p>
            <p>

               Users love your product and you're growing like crazy.  Your engineering
                team is already stretched thin keeping up with growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                You're using more cloud instances, apps, containers, languages,
                frameworks, and databases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your ops team (if you have one) is already under water trying to keep up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flynn helps you breeze through those challenges.

                Developers can deploy with a single command straight from git. Operators
                manage a single platform instead of doing custom work before each app can
                be deployed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Databases manage themselves. Service discovery, scheduling, containers,
                routing, and cluster management are all taken care of in the background.
